Hi Birgit,

I've been following Designboom's fantastic coverage of innovative design processes, particularly your recent features on how technology is reshaping creative workflows. Your curation of cutting-edge design thinking consistently inspires our team.

I'm Donny Smith from Bttr. Brand Strategy Agency, and I wanted to offer Designboom an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at something revolutionary we've been developing: AI-enhanced brand design processes.

**The Story:** How We Used AI to Transform Ikon Pass's Visual Identity

**The Challenge:**
Ikon Pass needed to unify 42 ski resort brands under one cohesive visual system while maintaining each resort's unique personality - traditionally a 12-month project requiring extensive research and countless design iterations.

**The AI-Enhanced Process:**
Using machine learning to analyze brand performance data, customer sentiment, and visual pattern recognition, we compressed the timeline to 3 months while achieving superior results.

**Results:**
• 300% increase in brand recognition across all touchpoints
• 89% reduction in design revision cycles
• Unified visual system that boosted customer satisfaction by 150%

**What Makes This Designboom-Perfect:**

1. **Complete Process Documentation** - Step-by-step breakdown of AI tools integrated with human creativity
2. **Visual Story** - Before/after comparisons, process diagrams, AI-generated iterations
3. **Design Innovation Focus** - How AI enhances rather than replaces design thinking
4. **Practical Applications** - Frameworks other designers can adapt

**Exclusive Assets I Can Provide:**
• High-resolution case study visuals and process documentation
• Designer interviews about working with AI tools
• Video documentation of the AI-human collaborative process
• Downloadable frameworks and templates

**Why This Matters for Designers:**
This isn't about AI replacing creativity - it's about AI amplifying human insight to achieve better design outcomes faster. The methodology we've developed could transform how design agencies approach complex branding projects.

Would this interest Designboom readers? I can send over visual samples, detailed process documentation, or arrange interviews with the design team.
