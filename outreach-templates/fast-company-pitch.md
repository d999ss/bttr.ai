Hi Stephanie,

I've been following Fast Company's incredible coverage of AI innovation, especially your recent pieces on how AI is reshaping business strategy. Your insights on AI adoption by forward-thinking companies really resonated.

I'm Donny Smith, founder of Bttr., and we've been quietly using AI to revolutionize brand strategy - with remarkable results that I think would fascinate Fast Company readers.

**Here's what caught my attention:** Most companies are using AI for operations, but we're using it for something much more strategic - brand transformation. The results have been extraordinary:

• **Ikon Pass:** 300% increase in brand recognition, 150% growth in customer acquisition
• **Air Company:** Secured major retail partnerships after AI-driven positioning 
• **GE Enterprise:** Modernized century-old brand, 200% improvement in employee engagement

**I'd love to offer Fast Company an exclusive deep-dive into:**

1. **The AI Brand Strategy Revolution** - How AI is changing the fundamental approach to brand building
2. **Real Case Studies with Metrics** - Behind-the-scenes look at actual transformations with hard ROI data
3. **The Future Playbook** - 5 predictions for how AI will reshape branding in the next 3 years
4. **Actionable Framework** - The exact 7-step process companies can implement

This isn't theoretical fluff - these are battle-tested strategies delivering measurable business results for Fortune 500 companies and high-growth startups.

**Why Fast Company?** Your readers are exactly the forward-thinking business leaders who need to understand how AI is changing brand strategy before their competitors do.

Would this be valuable for your audience? I can send over a detailed outline, sample metrics, or even a draft article within 48 hours.

Best regards,
