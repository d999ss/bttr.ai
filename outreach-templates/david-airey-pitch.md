Hi David,

I've been following Logo Design Love for years and your insights on brand identity design have been incredibly valuable. Your recent book "Identity Designed: The Process" particularly resonated with how we approach our work at Bttr.

I'm Donny Smith, founder of Bttr. Brand Strategy Agency, and I wanted to share something fascinating we've been developing that I think would interest your readers.

**The Story:** We've been using AI to enhance (not replace) the logo design process - with remarkable results:

• **Ikon Pass:** Created a unified visual system for 42 ski resorts in 3 months instead of 12, achieving 300% better brand recognition
• **Air Company:** Developed their entire brand identity using AI-assisted iteration, leading to major retail partnerships
• **Process Innovation:** 89% reduction in revision cycles while maintaining design quality

**What makes this Logo Design Love-perfect:**

1. **Human-Centered AI** - AI amplifies designer creativity rather than replacing it
2. **Complete Process Documentation** - Step-by-step methodology other designers can adapt
3. **Real Results** - Actual metrics from completed projects, not theoretical concepts
4. **Visual Assets** - Before/after comparisons, process diagrams, iteration examples

**Exclusive Content I Can Provide:**
• The exact 7-step AI-enhanced logo design framework
• Case study visuals showing the AI-human collaborative process
• Designer interviews about working with AI tools
• Downloadable templates and process guides

**Why This Matters for Logo Designers:**
Your readers are always looking for ways to improve their process while delivering better results. This methodology shows how AI can help designers explore more variations, test concepts faster, and achieve superior outcomes - all while keeping human insight at the center.

Would this be valuable for Logo Design Love readers? I can provide sample visuals, detailed process documentation, or a complete case study write-up.

Best regards,

P.S. I'd be happy to create custom visual documentation specifically for your audience format - I know how important great visuals are for Logo Design Love content.
